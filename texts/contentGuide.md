# Content Editor's Guide - PRC Website

## File Structure
Each program requires at least two markdown files:
1. `intro.md` - Brief program introduction (appears on all program pages)
2. `full.md` - Complete program description

## Content Format Requirements
- Use plain text only (no formatting)
- Submit content using markdown format
- Include empty lines before and after special elements (images, lists, etc.)

## Adding Media
To include images in your content:
1. Place image files in the same folder as your content
2. Reference images using angle brackets: `<imagename.png>`

Example:
```
Here is some text.

<demographicChart.png>

Continuing with more text.
```

## Adding Links
- Internal links: Use asterisks around page names: *Related Program*
- External links: Add reference at bottom of document:
```
*External Site Name* <https://example.com>
```

## News and Events Format
Use this structure for each event entry:
```
- title: Event Name
- date: Month DD, YYYY
- short: Brief description (1-2 sentences)
- full: URL or detailed description

---
```

## What to Avoid
- No direct formatting (bold, italic, etc.)
- No embedded content (iframes, videos) without prior approval
- No inline data tables (provide as downloadable CSV/PDF instead)
