# PSU and PRC Mandate

Portland State University was called upon by the Oregon Legislature to produce the annual estimates under (ORS 190.510 to 190.620), and Oregon Administrative Rule 577-050-0005. These estimates help decision-makers and planners in many sectors: health, education, infrastructure, and housing, and they are used to distribute the State's revenues.

## Publication Schedule

Population estimates are prepared as of July 1 of each year. Preliminary estimates are released around November 15th each year. We send a letter to state and local jurisdictions and post them here. Certified estimates are posted on December 15th. Supplemental reports are published quarterly, and are posted here two weeks after the end of each quarter. These reflect changes in population due to annexations and other revisions.

## Estimates Timeline

To ensure accurate and timely updates to our population data, we follow a structured timeline throughout the year. Here are the key dates and activities for the Population Estimate Program:

- May/June: Send letters to update contact details for county and city officials.
- July: Distribute the Annual Housing Unit and Population Survey (AHUPS) to all contacts in counties and cities.
- November 15: Mail preliminary estimates to all counties and cities, and publish on the website. Feedback and questions can be sent to popest@pdx.edu within one month.
- December 15: Publish certified estimates.
- April 15: Release the annual population report.
