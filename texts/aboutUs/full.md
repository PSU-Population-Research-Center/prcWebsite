The Population Research Center (PRC) is an interdisciplinary public service, research, and training unit for population-related data and research for the State of Oregon.

The mission of PRC is to provide population data, information, and research analysis for Oregon and its communities. Resource-wise, this means providing PRC staff and students with administrative, computing, and information services that support their population-related agendas. Center staff engage in a variety of demographic activities, including the Oregon State Data Center, the Oregon Population Estimates and Projections Program, and a variety of population projects. PRC staff also teach in the Nohad A. Toulan School of Urban Studies and Planning, supporting a graduate concentration in applied demography and a graduate certificate program in applied demography.

The specific activities of the Population Research Center are:

To prepare population estimates for the state of Oregon and its cities and counties, including work in cooperation with the U.S. Census Bureau as Oregon's designated agency in the Federal-State Cooperative Program for Local Population Estimates.
To participate actively in the U.S. Census Bureau's cooperative program as the state's lead agency for the Oregon State Data Center.
To prepare population analysis and reports on the state's population and characteristics as well as for local areas.
To serve as a source of demographic expertise for the state and provide demographic services on contract.
To staff graduate courses in the area of applied demography and related fields.


How the Population Research Center serves Oregon
Nationally recognized, nonpartisan source of demographic data and expertise for Oregon and its communities. 

PSU offers the only graduate level demographic training and certification in Oregon. 

Produces data and research for implementation of policies tied to population size or housing growth: these data are used within Oregon’s state and local government to ensure equitable distribution of tax revenue, better land use planning, determine appropriation of various state and federal program funds, and for other public policy priorities including education, public health, and redistricting.

PRC’s mission is to be a world-class center of training and knowledge for solutions to problems in applied demography, including population estimates, projections, geospatial analysis, and census-taking.
CENSUS
The State Data Center (SDC) is a cooperative program with the U.S. Census Bureau that makes demographic and socio-economic data and information accessible to through a network of local experts. The SDC serves state and local government agencies and the general public in numerous ways:

Federal census. SDC collaborates with the Census Bureau to improve the quality of Oregon's data by
supporting the decennial census and other programs through outreach and engagement.

Special district estimates and projections. SDC produces estimates and projections for school districts to meet their statutory reporting requirements (ORS 195.11); also library districts (ORS 357.78), utility districts, and redistricting for local governments and associations.

DEMOGRAPHIC ESTIMATES
PRC produces annual estimates of the size and composition of the housing stock and resident population of Oregon’s cities and counties (ORS 190), used for diverse purposes, including: 

Appropriations.
For example, funds from taxes on liquor (ORS 221), amusement devices (ORS 320 and 471)
and cigarettes (ORS 323), and a portion of vehicle fees (ORS 366), special transportation funds (ORS 391), and mental health services (ORS 430).

Federal estimates.
The PRC collaborates with the US Census Bureau to update federal databases leading up to the decennial census. Thereafter, PRC annually consults with the Census Bureau to ensure that boundary changes and housing and population dynamics are accurately reflected in federal datasets, ensuring the equitable allocation of federal funds.

POPULATION PROJECTIONS
PRC produces long-run projections of the population of the state of Oregon, its counties, and the population in each of Oregon’s Urban Growth Boundary (UGB) areas. These projections are used to inform decisions on when and how to expand UGBs to accommodate expected growth (ORS 195).

In addition to the core activities above, PRC also offers:

Training.
The faculty of PRC support PSU’s graduate certificate program in demography, as well as annual workshops, site visits, consulting, and speaking engagements.

Special projects and enumerations.
PRC faculty engage in a variety of activities including local population censuses or surveys, geocoding or GIS analysis, and research on health, environment, migration, family, and other important and policy-relevant subjects that benefit from demographic data or methods.
