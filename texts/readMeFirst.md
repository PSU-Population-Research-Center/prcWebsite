# Instruction to Content Writers

Below are guidelines for preparing content for the PRC Website. The new design aims to accommodate a substantial amount of content while minimizing the number of templates used. Most pages will have a uniform appearance, with variations primarily in the text from one page to another. To illustrate, I've filled out some content for the estimate program that you can copy and modify.

## General Considerations

Content should be provided as plain text with no formatting. Please use the markdown content template to submit your content. At least two pieces of content are required for each program, but you are welcome to add more as needed:

- intro.md: This will serve as a brief introduction to the program and will appear on all pages related to the program.
- full.md: This file should contain the full description of the program. Consider including a methods section here or create a dedicated page for it.

Please note that the list of downloadable data is not part of these pages and will follow a different content specification later.

## Inline Image and Media

If an image or video needs to appear at a given location within your content, please put the image in the same folder as your content and reference the image as follows:

<exampleImage.png>

Then the remainder of the text continues. Please include an empty line before and after the image.

## Internal and External Links

You can also add an inline link to another page within the website as follows: Please see *Example page* for more information. The same applies for *External Page* except that you need to add a reference (see below) to the external link.

## Embedded Content

We should streamline all our content to be in plain text as much as possible. If for some reason we MUST insert online embedded content such as iframes, videos, or interactive maps, we will need to discuss on a case-by-case basis.

## Downloadable Datatables

All tables should be provided as downloadable CSV or PDF files. A different set of instructions for downloadable data tables will be provided. But you can add an inline link to a specific data set using the same process above.
